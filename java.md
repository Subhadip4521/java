### Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

The line Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); in Java is used to create an instance of the Scanner class, which is a part of the java.util package. This instance, sc, is then used to read input from the standard input stream, typically the keyboard.

Here's a breakdown of the components:

1) Scanner sc:

Scanner is a class in Java that provides methods for reading input of various types, such as strings, integers, and floating-point numbers.
sc is the variable name you've chosen for the Scanner object. You could name it anything, but sc is commonly used as a shorthand.

2) new Scanner(System.in):

new is a keyword that creates a new object.
Scanner(System.in) creates a Scanner object that reads input from System.in, which represents the standard input stream in Java (usually the keyboard).
